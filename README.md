# Qelectrotech-wiki

This repo contains the source for an experimental [Qelectrotech (QET)](https://qelectrotech.org/) wiki using the [Sphinx Python tool](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/fr/master/).

The main reason for the existence of this thing is that the old wiki is (very) out of date as it has seen very little writers/contributors over the years. 

This wiki would also allow the devs to bundle an offline copy of the manual with the QET installations, requiring only a browser to visualise it.

The objective of that repo is that it will be used at some point by the QET devs. Contributions are welcome.

## Setup

You will now learn on how to setup and use the sphinx tool

1) Setup a [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) (please name it "venv" as the .gitignore is configure to not track his changes) and follow the activation procedure.
2) Use pip to install the requirements.txt file
3) Run "make html" in your terminal
4) Open the "build/html/index.html" file in your browser of choice and profit.
5) Done!
